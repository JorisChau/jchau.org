Hello, my name is Joris and I am currently a statistical consultant at [Open Analytics](https://openanalytics.eu) in Antwerp, Belgium. After studying mathematics at [Utrecht Univerity](https://www.uu.nl) in the Netherlands, I obtained my PhD in Statistics from ([UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/index.html)) in Belgium under the supervision of Rainer von Sachs. 

As a PhD student my research mainly focused on wavelets, nonparametric regression and time series analysis (in the frequency domain), but my interests are much broader and include any engaging topic in mathematical or computational statistics from which I can learn something new. In my daily work, I primarily use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) as a statistical software, and I am always interested in learning about new R-packages or efficient R programming in general. 

The aim of this minimal blog is to collect and share some (opinionated) insights and code as much for myself as for any interested reader. All views expressed in this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my employer or any other entity I am affiliated with.
